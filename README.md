## My Music Google Doodle

I chose to have my theme be music, because that is something that has always been important to me. I played piano as a kid for 10 years, and I played percussion and drumline in high school. I recently started making music at the beginning of quarantine last february, and now I'm taking it more seriously and it is one of my favorite things to do. The speakers I'm using in my google doodle are replicas of my own set.
